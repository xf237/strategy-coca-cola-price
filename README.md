## Overview

This repository contains a factor_based trading strategy implementation based on quantitative analysis and systematic market research. The strategy is designed to identify and exploit market inefficiencies while maintaining robust risk management protocols.

### Key Features

- Quantitative signal generation using mathematical models
- Risk-adjusted portfolio construction with dynamic position sizing
- Real-time execution framework with transaction cost optimization
- Comprehensive performance analytics and reporting
- Multi-layered risk controls and position limits
- Extensive backtesting with statistical validation

### Target Performance Metrics

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Sharpe Ratio | > 1.5 |
| Maximum Drawdown | < 15% |
| Volatility Target | 12-18% annualized |
| Rebalancing | Daily/Weekly |
| Minimum Capital | $100,000+ |

## Research Hypothesis

**Primary Hypothesis (H₁)**: The factor_based trading approach will generate risk-adjusted returns superior to passive market exposure.

---


## Theoretical Framework

### Market Efficiency & Behavioral Finance Foundation
The strategy exploits systematic deviations from market efficiency.

---


## Research Methodology

### Phase I: Strategy Development Framework
Comprehensive hypothesis formation and testing protocol.

---

## Implementation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- 16GB+ RAM recommended
- Stable internet connection for data feeds

### Installation

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/chris-cpz/strategy-coca-cola-price.git
cd strategy-coca-cola-price

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/macOS
# venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Configuration

Create a `.env` file with your API keys:

```bash
# Required API Keys
ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY=your_key_here
IEX_CLOUD_API_KEY=your_key_here
QUANDL_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

### Quick Start

```python
from strategy import cocacolapriceStrategy

# Initialize strategy
strategy = cocacolapriceStrategy()

# Load data and run backtest
data = strategy.load_data(['SPY', 'QQQ'], '2020-01-01', '2023-12-31')
results = strategy.backtest(data)
strategy.generate_report(results)
```

---

## Backtesting Framework

### Validation Process

- **Historical Analysis**: 10+ years of market data
- **Walk-Forward Testing**: 12-month optimization with 6-month validation
- **Monte Carlo Simulation**: 10,000+ scenarios for statistical significance
- **Stress Testing**: Performance during market crashes and volatility spikes

### Transaction Cost Modeling

- Realistic bid-ask spreads and market impact
- Dynamic slippage based on order size and liquidity
- Optimal execution strategies (TWAP, VWAP)
